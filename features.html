  Food waste is a huge problem both globally and individually. Studies show that 1/3 of food produced is wasted globally, and even more shockingly a study on household food waste in Canada shows on average 63% of food waste we produce should be avoidable. Not only is this a problem environmentally, but also financially. Not knowing how to cook leads to spending too much money on fast food and leads to food waste when we buy things that go bad before they can be used. Our app aims to help prevent food waste by helping users understand how quickly foods need to be used, tracking what they buy so they don’t over shop, and teaching how to store, preserve, and overall extend the shelf life of groceries

               We decided that we were going to create an app that allows you to scan your receipts from grocery shopping, these receipts would then be analyzed by an AI and would generate expiration dates based on online information. This was the original idea, which sounded great on its own, we slowly kept building on this idea adding new sections to what would become our app. <br> The main section is My Fridge, which would learn what foods a user often needs or buys and using the fridge section would tell you when you are out of staple products. Users input the foods they want like a normal shopping list, but the app will also suggest certain pairings, like what vegetables would go well with what you commonly buy. <br> We added a section for meal preparation which would show the user recipes that they could make based on what they had purchased. These recipes are be suggested by what food they have scanned, and what needs to be used up the soonest. Users can save their favourites or submit their own recipes as well. <br> tips and tricks is a simple quick check for how long common foods last. This way, you know not to buy too many foods that expire quickly all at once or know what food you should use or preserve before a trip, so you don’t come home to a moldy fridge. The fridge section tells users what products they have in the fridge, freezer, and pantry/non cold storage. It also tells users where to store specific types of products. For example, milk should be stored at the back of the fridge, not on the door, since it needs to be cold for optimal storage. (a very common health hazard!) <br> finally, we have our FAQ to explain our mission, tell users about how they can help prevent food waste locally, and to spread the word about the importance of preventing waste.

                The logo is inspired by an inside joke started by our developers back in 2018. Wormy John is the true name for the logo. Wormy John is an imaginary villain created by one of the developers. Wormy John has been a constant in all projects made by the team and will continue to represent the undying friendship shared by the developers as they move forward with projects.

          We have been asked this question once in a blue moon, and have realized the great demand for this application for the few people that ask for it. Based on its want, our team has been ever so slightly working tirelessly to get this app to link with your smart fridge. However due to the rising technology we are constantly having to re-do our app in order to keep it working on your fridge. We refuse to release an unfinished product.
